# 🎼 **Bio-Data Music Portrait – Translating saliva into Music** 🎶  

🔬 **A data-driven approach to composing music from biological signals**  

This notebook explores how saliva-related biomarkers data can be transformed into musical elements through structured analysis. The project aims to create a **data-driven musical portrait** by mapping biological variations to pitch, rhythm, and dynamics.  

## **✨ What does this notebook do?**  
- **Processes biological (saliva) data** to extract meaningful patterns  
- **Maps numerical values to musical parameters** (pitch, duration, intensity)  
- **Creates musical scores based on biometrics**  
- **Exports compositions in MusicXML & MIDI formats** for further arrangement  
- **Visualizes patterns in biological data and their correlation with musical structure**  🎶
